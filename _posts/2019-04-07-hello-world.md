Hi, my name is Lucas Felix de Sousa.

I'm a brazilian/portuguese Java Developer that now is living in Munich.

I had a blog some years ago, but I gave up, now I want to start it again.

The idea will be to share some knowledge of the technologies that I'm current working such as: Java, Kotlin, Spring, Netflix OSS, AWS and so on, stay tuned!
